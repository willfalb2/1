            <h2>Who We Are:</h2>
            <p>
                Inqueery is a student-led organization within Ecology House. We are a diverse group of individuals who are
                passionate about creating an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of their sexual
                orientation or gender identity.

            <h2>What We Do:</h2>
            <p>
                At Inqueery, we hold bi-weekly meetings where we engage in thoughtful discussions on a wide range of topics
                related to queerness. These meetings are open to all, whether you're part of the Ecology House community or
                simply interested in learning more.

                Throughout the semester, we try to organize at least one major event for LGBTQ+ individuals and allies to come
